# catchAll
A simple game using ml5.js, p5.js, and a little bit of HTML and CSS. It tracks users' "poses" through ml5 and uses the p5.js javascript online editor for players to interact with the game itself.


By using some trigonometry and math, the program can deduce where your palm coordinates are (by getting your wrist and elbow coordinates and extending them). Using the palm coordinates, players can navigate through the menu and play the game itself, which is a simple "egg catcher" game.


I thank the p5.js and ml5 community for the amazing tools they have provided me!
